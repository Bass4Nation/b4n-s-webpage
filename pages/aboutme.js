      <p>
        Hi. Im Kristoffer Snopestad SÃ¸derkvist, right now as Mars 2022 I&apos;m still
        a bachelor student at HIOF (Halden University). I like to code most
        language I&apos;ve tried yet, but some better than other like JavaScript with
        framework such as Node.js, React.js, NEXT.js. Also like C# and Java.
      </p>
      <p>But when I get some freetime I like to play videogames on my computer, and watch and try to learn some japanese language. Plus sometime I like to start on my own projects 
      like this webpage, or try to get my drone to work with some UDP commands</p>
    </>
