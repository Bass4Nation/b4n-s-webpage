      <p>Hi. I&apos;m Kristoffer Snopestad SÃ¸derkvist, and are now seeking a job in the IT universe. I Have finished my bachelor assignment, and are currently (17.june) 
        waiting for answere on other exam's I had. I like to code most
        language I&apos;ve tried yet, but some better than other like JavaScript with
        framework such as Node.js, React.js, NEXT.js. Also like C# and Java. </p>
      <p>But when I get some freetime I like to play videogames on my computer, and watch and try to learn some japanese language. Plus sometime I like to start on my own projects 
      like this webpage, or try to get my drone to work with some UDP commands</p>
    </>
